# 6 - Build a database

The deployed classifier will have an on-board database of action snippets. A real-time frame buffer will compare its contents against these representative samples and find a best match. Therefore, we want this database to be rich enough that a good match is likely, but not so full that it becomes too much to search. The script `build_db.py` therefore lets us strategically thin out the database to what are (hopefully) the most definitive samples.
