#  Objects subject to an IGNORE rule are ignored completely.
#  Objects subject to a PERMIT rule are included in the *_subprops.txt file to be used later but are
#                                   understood to be singletons: they have no components or parts.
#  Objects subject to a DEFINE rule read as follows: DEFINE <A> <B> ==> <A> is an instance of <B>
#                                                    Note that <B> may not be a "real" type; it may be an intermediate subject to a COND.
#  Objects subject to a COLLECT rule read as follows: COLLECT <A_0> AS <l_0>... <A_n> AS <l_n> <B> ==> <A_0> through <A_n> make up a single instance of <B>
#                                                     Throughout, refer to <A_i> as <l_i>.
#                                                     Note that this is how we invent labels that do not otherwise exist.
#  Objects subject to a COND rule read as follows: COND <A> <B> <C> <D> <type> X ==> An instance of <A> is an instance <B>
#                                                                                    if component <C> has attribute <D> == X of <type>
