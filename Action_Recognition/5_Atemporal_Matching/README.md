# 5 - Perform atemporal matching

Though the purpose of this pipeline is to arrive at real-time action classifier, it is helpful to run classification atemporally to establish a baseline and determine downstream parameters.

## Inputs


## Outputs


## Requirements

Notice that at this point in the pipeline, we have abstracted classification away from using actual enactment video frames. We will re-introduce video input when we proceed to real-time classification.
