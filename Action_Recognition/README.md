# Action Recognition

## Build a first-person action classification system from VR enactments

This repository contains the modules of a pipeline. The primordial inputs are labeled recordings of actions performed in a virtual environment. The output is a real-time action classification system, though there are several intermediate products and by-products on the way to developing this classifier.
